# Email service SMTP host (e.g., smtp.gmail.com, smtp.sendgrid.net, smtp.mailgun.org)
NODE_MAILER_HOST=your-smtp-host.com

# Port number (587 for TLS, 465 for SSL, 25 for unencrypted, or custom port based on provider)
NODE_MAILER_PORT=your-smtp-port

# Sender email address (e.g., your-email@example.com)
NODE_MAILER_FROM_EMAIL=your-email@example.com

# Password or API Key (depending on the service, this could be an email password, an app-specific password, or an API key)
NODE_MAILER_PASSWORD=your-email-or-api-key

# (Optional) If you need to enable secure connection or other settings for the service, you can add:
NODE_MAILER_SECURE=true  # true for SSL, false for TLS or other settings
# Port 465 is generally used for SSL, while Port 587 is used for TLS.
# If you're using Port 465, you should set secure: true, which indicates SSL should be used.
# If you're using Port 587, you should set secure: false and rely on STARTTLS (which is TLS).
