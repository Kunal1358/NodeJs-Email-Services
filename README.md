# NodeJs-Email-Services

This is a simple Node.js script that sends an email with embedded content and includes downloadable attachments using **Nodemailer**.


## Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following:

- **Node.js** installed on your machine (You can download it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/)).
- **Nodemailer** package installed for sending emails.
- **Environment variables** configured for your email service.

### 1. Install Dependencies

First, you need to install **Nodemailer**. In your project directory, run the following command to install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install nodemailer
```

### 2. Run the `index.js` File
```bash
node index.js
```

This will execute the `index.js` file, and if everything is configured correctly, an email will be sent with the specified content.

## You can play with *configurations* depending on the use case.
